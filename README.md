# Algorithms1
Divide and conquer, sorting and searching and randomized algorithms, Stanford University:

This is the first part of the Algorithms Illuminated course taught by Tim Roughgarden. It covers the algorithms in all of Algorithms Illuminated Part I and the first chapter of Algorithms Illuminated part II. 

Alongside the course I worked through the discrete math textbook Mathematics for comupter science, Leighton, Lehmen and Meyer. This book covers useful material on proofs, recursive structures, counting and set theory, probability and recurrences. It provided a useful theoretical framework for the analysis of algorithms. 

Algorithms practice included tests and a final exam on:
 - asymptotic notation
 - integer multiplication including Karatsuba
 - divide and conquer algorithms, including Strassen's matrix multiplication and closest pair in O(n logn)
 - the master method and proof
 - quicksort, including randomized quicksort
 - RSelect and DSelect
 - graphs, DFS, BFS, connected components and min-cuts, including Karger's min-cut
 
 I passed the final exam with 100%
