# Algorithms1
Divide and conquer, sorting and searching and randomized algorithms, Stanford University:

This is the first part of the [Algorithms Illuminated course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer) taught by [Tim Roughgarden.](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~768) It covers all of the algorithms in the book [Algorithms Illuminated Part I](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Illuminated-Part-1-Basics-ebook/dp/B075YQP38X) and the first chapter of [Algorithms Illuminated part II.](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Illuminated-Part-Graph-Structures-ebook/dp/B07G6X2XMG)

Alongside the course I worked through the discrete math textbook [Mathematics for comupter science, Leighton, Lehmen and Meyer.](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Computer-Science-Eric-Lehman/dp/1680921223/) This book covers useful material on proofs, recursive structures, counting and set theory, probability and recurrences. It provided a useful theoretical framework for the analysis of algorithms. 

Algorithms practice included tests and a final exam on:
 - asymptotic notation
 - integer multiplication including Karatsuba
 - divide and conquer algorithms, including Strassen's matrix multiplication and closest pair in O(n logn)
 - the master method and proof
 - quicksort, including randomized quicksort
 - RSelect and DSelect
 - graphs, DFS, BFS, connected components and min-cuts, including Karger's min-cut
 
 I [passed the final exam with 100%](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/JANQNW95VUBH)
