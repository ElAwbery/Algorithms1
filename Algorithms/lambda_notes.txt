Syntax is 

lambda arg/s: expression

expression is something that returns a value
The whole thing can only be one line

Caan't include statements (only an expression returning a value, nothing else)

map takes two args, one is a function (which could be a lambda) and a list
applies the function to the elements of the list
returns a new list, same length as the old list whose elements are the vals
returned by the applied function
